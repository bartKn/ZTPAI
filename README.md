# BillSplit Web Application 

This project was created during 'Advanced technologies for developing web applications' course. It allows you to calculate how much you owe each other after spending together. And for users who set up an account, it allows you to create a split with your friends, which will be automatically settled after each of you enters the amount you put into the shared pot.
